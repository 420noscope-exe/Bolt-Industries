About the firmware:

BMK.ino is BMK with shortcut keys in place of most of the Function keys. 
BMK_Basic.ino is the same firmware with all the basic keyboard keys and no macros.
BMK_CapsLockSupport is also the same firmware (and macros), but also has full Caps Lock support.  It can read the Caps Lock value from the OS.  Both RepeatDelay Values have also been increased.
code.py is for use with KMK mechanical keyboard firmware.
