About the firmware:

BMK.ino is BMK with shortcut keys in place of most of the Function keys. 
BMK_Basic.ino is the same firmware with all the basic keyboard keys and no macros.
BMK_CapsLockSupport.ino is also the same as BMK.ino, but has full CapsLock support, and can read the CapsLock state from the OS.  Both RepeatDelay values have also been increased for usability.  The OS repeats key presses when held at its own rate aynway.
code.py is for use with KMK mechanical keyboard firmware.
